INTEL 8080 quick and dirty emulator.

I/O supported : TTY

Paper tape support next in line

Tested with LLL fp library and it works (at least floating point division)

It requires odt.asm (basic I/O routines)

The emulator accepts as input hex files

Do not work under Windows, due to the terminal emulation specifically designed for UNIX systems.
You can use Visual Studio, with remote debugging.
